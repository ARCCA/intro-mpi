## Summary

This course has hopefully introduced the topic of MPI and its features.  There is however many aspects not coverred such
as:
- dynamic process management
- one-sided communication
- persistent communications

As mentioned in the introduction, MPI is a large standard but to get useful work done it only requires a small subset of
calls.  Just be aware of the whole range of features in case its useful in your application.
